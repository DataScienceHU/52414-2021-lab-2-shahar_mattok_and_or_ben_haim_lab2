### Q0.Submission Instructions  
  
This lab will be submitted in pairs using GitHub (if you don't have a pair, please contact us).  
Please follow the steps in the  [GitHub-Classroom Lab 2](https://classroom.github.com/g/6_Wy5z44) to create your group's Lab 2 repository.  
**Important: your team's name must be `FamilyName1_Name1_and_FamilyName2_Name2`**.  
You can collaborate with your partner using the git environment; You can either make commits straight to master, or create individual branches (recommended). However, once done, be sure to merge your branches to master - you will be graded using the most recent *master* version - your last push and merge before the deadline.   
**Please do not open/review other peoples' repositories - we will be notified by GitHub if you do.**

Your final push should include this Rmd file (with your answers) together with the html file that is outputted automatically by knitr when you knit the Rmd. Anything else will be disregarded. In addition, please adhere to the following file format:    
`Lab_2_FamilyName1_Name1_and_FamilyName2_Name2.Rmd/html`      

Some questions may require data wrangling and manipulation which you need to decide on. <br>
In some graphs you may need to change the graph limits. If you do so, please include the outlier 
points you have removed in a separate table.

Show numbers in plots/tables using standard digits and not scientific display. That is: 90000000 and not 9e+06. <br>
Round numbers to at most 3 digits after the dot - that is, 9.456 and not 9.45581451044


The required libraries are listed below the instructions. You are allowed to add additional libraries if you want. 
If you do so, *please explain what libraries you've added, and what is each new library used for*. 

#### Background: 

You've been hired as a data analyst at at football (soccer) club. 
Since this is a small and under-funded club, you will not have access to real-football data, but to data from 
the football computer game fifa18. Your job is to analyze this dataset and extract meaningful insights from the data in order 
to help your club make better decisions. 

#### Data File: 
You will load and analyze the fifa18 football dataset file called "fifa_data.csv". <br> 
The dataset contains detailed information about each player in the game, including: names, age, nationality, overall ability, estimated potential ability, current club and league, market value, salary (wage), ability at different football skills (also called 'attributes', e.g. Ball.control, Sprint.speed ...), ability to play at different position in the game (CF, CM, ...) and the preferred positions of the player.

<br/><br/>

## Q1. Basic Univariate Statistics (30 pt)         

First, you are requested to load the fifa18 dataset and find and display general information about the players. 

a. Make a plot showing the `overall` ability distribution of all players.
How skewed is the distributions? does it have fat tails?  <br>
Plot on top of the `overall` distribution a Normal distribution matching its first two moments. Is the distribution described well by a Normal distribution? explain. 

b. Make a plot comparing the multiple `overall` ability *distributions* of players according to the `continent` of the players.  Describe which continents have especially good/bad players. 

c. Make a plot showing the density of players' `value` distribution. <br>
Next, make a separate plot showing the density distribution of the *log* of players' `value`. <br>
Which of the two visualizations is better? explain. 

d. Are the top-10 players with the highest `value` also the top-10 best players in terms of `overall` ability? 
Show tables for both and compare. <br> 
Who is the best player not in the top-10 valued players?  

e. Show a table of the *10* *youngest* and *10* *oldest* teams in terms of *average* players `age`. 


Loading the data:
```{r}
fifa_players <- data.frame(read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataScienceHU/DataAnalysisR_2020/master/data/fifa_data.csv")))
#fifa_players <- data.frame(read.csv("../../../../Datasets/fifa_data.csv")) 
# Pre-processing: 
for (i in c(3,6,7,10:71)) {
  fifa_players[,i]<-as.numeric((fifa_players[,i]))
}
fifa<-na.omit(fifa_players)
fifa_players <- fifa
fifa_players_info <- fifa[,c(1:11)] # players general info 
fifa_players_attribures <- fifa[,c(1,12:45, 6)] # players different skills. Add overall
fifa_players_positions <- fifa[,c(1,46:72,6,7)] # players ability at different positions . Add overall 
fifa_players_indicators <- fifa[,c(1,6,7,10,11)] # players general ability 

```


```{r}
#q1a
x<-fifa_players_info$Overall
u <- fifa_players_info$Overall
z <- rnorm(length(u), mean(u), sd(u))  # Normal data with the same first two moments 
d.u <- data.frame(val=c(u, z), label=as.factor(c(rep('Real data overall ability', length(u)), rep('Normal', length(u)))))
d.u %>% ggplot(aes(val, fill=label)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2)+labs(title="overall ability distribution of all players",
            x="overall ability  ", y="density")+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+labs(
         colour = "name1"
        )
qqnorm(x)
qqline(x, col = "red", lwd = 2)
print(skewness(x))
```
As we see in the graph there is a long thick tail on the right side from point 85 to 94. And on the left side there is a short tail from point 46 to 50. And the skewnes is positive 0.008293 and that tell us the is long tail in the right ,forther more we can see that the normal distribution  line is more the same with the overall ability distribution

```{r}
DF <- data.frame(select(fifa_players, Overall,Continent))
DF$Continent <- as.character(DF$Continent)
DF$Continent[DF$Continent == "South_america"] <-"South America"
DF$Continent[DF$Continent == "North_america"] <-"North America"
DF %>% 
  gather(Overall, Continent) %>%
  ggplot(aes(factor(Continent), Overall, fill = factor(Continent))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(panel.spacing = unit(0, "lines"),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none",
        strip.placement = "outside",
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(title="Overall Abilities per Continent", y="Overall Abilities")+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

It can be seen that the average player and most of the highest players is in South America. Because also the box is the highest also the highest player concentration in addition to the highest median from the rest of the continents.
```{r}
#q1c
Value <- data.frame(fifa_players$Value)
Value <- Value %>% filter(fifa_players.Value != "0")
Value_Distribution <- ggplot(Value, aes(x=fifa_players.Value)) + 
  geom_density() + labs(title="Value Distribution", x="Value", y="Density")+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Value_Distribution
Value_Distribution_Log <- ggplot(Value, aes(x=fifa_players.Value)) + 
  geom_density() + scale_x_log10() + labs(title="Value Distribution by Log Scale ", x="Value", y="Density") +theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
Value_Distribution_Log
```
The log visualization is better because we can see the differences between the Values more accurately.
In the regular plot, there is a fat tail which makes the graph uncomfortably less informative, unlike the log plot that has a clearer scale.
The log visualization is better described by a Normal Distribution as from the 100,000 Value to 10,000,000 we  have Similar to the Gauss Bell.
```{r}
#q1d
max_value <- fifa %>% select(Name, Value) %>% arrange(desc(Value)) %>% slice(1:10)
max_value
max_overall <- fifa %>% select(Name, Overall) %>% arrange(desc(Overall)) %>% slice(1:10)
max_overall

```
Most of the highest-valued players are the best players in terms of overall ability except for K. De Bruyne and P. Dybala.

```{r}
#q1e
olde_teams <- fifa %>% select(Club, Age) %>% group_by(Club) %>% summarise(Age = mean(Age)) %>% 
              arrange(desc(Age))%>% slice(1:10) 
as.data.frame(olde_teams)

young_teams <- fifa %>% select(Club, Age) %>% group_by(Club) %>% summarise(Age = mean(Age)) %>% 
              arrange((Age))%>% slice(1:10) 
as.data.frame(young_teams)

```

## Q2. Scouting Report (30 pt)

You are in charge of the scouting division. The goal of this division is to follow players' `potential` and `overall` ability, and identify undervalued players - that is, players whose current value is lower compared to what would be expected based on their predicted future ability. 

a. Plot the *average* `potential` ability by `age` of all players, for players 35 years old or younger

b. Plot the *average difference* between a player's `overall` ability to `potential` ability as a function of `age`, up to age 35. At what ages should we expect to find players for future development based on this graph?  

c. We are seeking young ($age \leq 21$) players with high `potential` ($>70$). Show a scatter plot of these players comparing their `potential` ability (x-axis) and current `value` (y-axis). <br>
Find the 10 most-undervalued players, i.e. having the lowest `value` compared to their predicted value by `potential` using a simple linear regression model. <br>
Calculate for each of them what is a fair `value` matching their `potential` that you be willing to pay in order to by them to your club and show these 10 players with their name, `age`, `overall` ability, `potential`, actual `value` and fair `value` it a table.

d. Your boss wants to fly abroad to recruit promising players. Use the `rworldmap` package to display the world map and color each country based on the *median* `potential` of players from this nationality. 

e. Repeat the above analysis but this time display a world map where each country is colored by the *median ratio* of `potential` to `value` of players. Find an under-valued country you'd recommend to travel to (i.e. a country with cheap players compared to their `potential` average quality). 


```{r}
#q2a
potential.up.to.35 <- fifa %>% select(Age,Potential) %>% group_by(Age) %>%summarise(Potential = mean(Potential))
potential.up.to.35<-potential.up.to.35[potential.up.to.35$Age<=35,]
ggplot(potential.up.to.35, aes(x=Age, y=Potential)) + geom_line(linetype = "dashed", color="black") +
  geom_point(color="lightseagreen", size=1.5) + labs(title = "Potential Abilities by Age") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```


```{r}
#q2b
overall.up.to.35 <- fifa %>% select(Age,Overall) %>% group_by(Age) %>% summarise(Overall = mean(Overall))
overall.up.to.35<-overall.up.to.35[overall.up.to.35$Age<=35,]
potential.up.to.35 <- fifa %>% select(Age,Potential) %>% group_by(Age) %>% summarise(Potential = mean(Potential)) 
potential.up.to.35<-potential.up.to.35[potential.up.to.35$Age<=35,]
up.to.35 <- inner_join(overall.up.to.35,potential.up.to.35)
up.to.35 <- up.to.35 %>% select(Age, Overall, Potential) %>% summarise(Age,Overall,Potential,Difference = abs(Overall-Potential))
#the difference is shown in an absolute value, so we can see that there is a gap between the overall ability and the potential (potential is always higher until age 16).
ggplot(up.to.35, aes(x=Age, y=Difference)) + geom_line(linetype = "dashed", color="black") +
  geom_point(color="lightseagreen", size=1.5) + labs(title = "Average Differene between Overall and Potential") +theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

We should expect to find players for future development at early ages, from about 16 to 25 years old.

```{r}
#q2c
potentials.players <- subset(fifa_players, Potential>70 & Age<=21)
ggplot(data = potentials.players,aes(x=Potential,y =Value ))+
  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y~x) +
  labs(title="potential ability  vs current value") +
  geom_point(aes(color=Potential))+theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
potentials <- lm(Potential ~ (Value), data=potentials.players)
potentials.players$resid <- round(resid(potentials), 5) 
potentials.players$fair_value <- round((potentials.players$Potential - potentials$coefficients[[1]]) / potentials$coefficients[[2]], 5)
print(potentials.players %>% arrange(desc(resid)) %>% select(Name, Age,Overall,Potential , Value, fair_value) %>% head(10))
```


```{r}
#q2d
nation_list <- fifa %>% select(Nationality) %>% na.omit()
nation_list <- recode_factor(nation_list$Nationality,"England"="United Kingdom",
                   "Scotland"="United Kingdom",
                   "Republic of Ireland"="United Kingdom",
                   "Wales"="United Kingdom",
                   "Czech Republic"="Czech Rep.")
nation_list_df <- as.data.frame(nation_list)
count_nation <- nation_list_df %>% count(nation_list) %>% rename("Count" = "n", "Nationality" = "nation_list")
join2map <- joinCountryData2Map(count_nation, joinCode = "NAME" , nameJoinColumn = "Nationality")
map.of.players <- mapCountryData(join2map, "Count", numCats = 12, mapTitle = "Number of Players per Nation", lwd = 1.2, catMethod = c(seq(0,2600,200)))
```


```{r}
#q2e
mean_nation <- fifa %>% select(Nationality, Overall)
mean_nation$Nationality <- as.character(mean_nation$Nationality)
mean_nation$Nationality[mean_nation$Nationality == "England"] <- "United Kingdom"
mean_nation$Nationality[mean_nation$Nationality == "Wales"] <- "United Kingdom"
mean_nation$Nationality[mean_nation$Nationality == "Republic of Ireland"] <- "United Kingdom"
mean_nation$Nationality[mean_nation$Nationality == "Scotland"] <- "United Kingdom"
mean_nation$Nationality[mean_nation$Nationality == "Czech Republic"] <- "Czech Rep."

mean_nation <- mean_nation %>% group_by(Nationality) %>% summarise(Overall = mean(Overall))
join2map.b <- joinCountryData2Map(mean_nation, joinCode = "NAME" , nameJoinColumn = "Nationality")
map.of.players <- mapCountryData(join2map.b, "Overall", numCats = 7, mapTitle = "Average Overall Abilities per Nation",
                                 lwd = 1.2, catMethod = c(seq(54,75,3)))
```


## Q3. Correlations Analysis (30 pt)

In this question we find and display different skills and their correlations

a. We are interested in finding out which positions are similar in terms of players' performance.  
Extract the 26 non-goalkeeper positions (`CAM, CB, ..., ST`). 
Calculate the correlation between players' ability in each pair of positions and show a heatmap correlation-plot of the correlations' matrix. What three positions have the *least* average correlations with other skills? <br>
We are interested in finding out which skills are similar in terms of players' performance at the position. 
Extract the 29 skills for non-goalkeeper players (Acceleration, ..., Volleys, except 'GK.*' skills). 
Calculate the correlation between players' ability in each pair of skills and show a heatmap correlation-plot of the correlations' matrix. What two skills seem least correlated with other skills? 

```{r}
position <-  fifa_players_positions %>% select(-c("ID","Preferred.Positions", "Overall" ,"Potential"))
corrplot(cor(position), order= "hclust" ,title = "correlation between players' ability map", cex.main=1, mar =c(0,0,1,0))

```

```{r}
attribures <- fifa_players_attribures[-c(1,13:17)]
corrplot(cor(attribures), order= "hclust" ,title = "attribures between players' ability map", cex.main=1, mar =c(0,0,1,0),cex.main=1, tl.cex = 0.5)

```

"rcb", "cb","lcb" positions are least average correlated with other positions.
strength and jumping are least correlated with other skills.


b. Consider the following indicators of players performance: `overall` players' performance, their `potential`, 
their salary (`wage`) and their market `value`. Show a correlation-plot of players' *34* skill levels 
(`Acceleration`, ..., `Volleys`) vs. these four indicators. Find the *10* skills with the highest *average* correlation with the four inidcators and list them in a table.   
```{r}
performance <-cor( fifa_players_attribures[-c(1,36)],fifa_players_indicators[-1])
corrplot(performance ,title = "attribures between players' ability map", cex.main=1, mar =c(0,0,1,0),cex.main=1, tl.cex = 0.5)
performance <- as.data.frame(performance)
performance$average <- ((performance$Overall+performance$Potential+performance$Value+performance$Wage)/4) 
top_n(performance,10,average) %>% select(average) %>%  arrange((desc(average)))

```

c. Build a team of *11 different* players with the following rules: <br>
- For each of the *26* non-goalkeaper positions (*26* from above plus goalkeaper, `GK`), find the player with the best performance at this position. <br>
- Find the goal keaper (`Preffered.Positions` is `GK`) with the best `overall` performance. <br>
- From the players obtained above, find *11 distinct* players maximizing the average `overall` performance of the team, 
with the constraint that there must be a goalkeaper (preferred position `GK`). <br>
- List the players in a table including their `overall` performance and the team average `overall` score. <br>
Next, peak six *different* players of your choice from your team, one of which is the goalkeaper. Using the function `radarchart::chartJSRadar`, graph their abilities (individually for all 6 players) in the top *10* skills according to 3.b in a [radar chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) (also called 'spider chart')  graph. See below an example for such a chart.


```{r}
our_team <- fifa[c(2,6,46:71)]
dteamcandidates<-data.frame(col)
dteamcandidates<-our_team[0,]
for (i in 3:27){
    dteamcandidates<-add_row(dteamcandidates,our_team[which.max(our_team[,i]),])
    our_team=subset(our_team,Name!=dteamcandidates$Name[i-2])
    }
goal_keepers<-filter(fifa,fifa$Preferred.Positions=='GK ')
best_goal_keeper<-which.max(goal_keepers$Overall)
best_goal_keeper<-goal_keepers[best_goal_keeper,]
best_team<-distinct(dteamcandidates)
best_team<-best_team %>% arrange(desc(Overall)) %>% head(10)
best_team<-add_row(best_team,best_goal_keeper[c(2,6,46:71)])
best_team<-mutate(best_team,mean_Overall=rep(mean(best_team$Overall),11))
best_team



team_chart<- best_team %>% arrange(Overall) %>% head(7)
team_chart<-subset(fifa,fifa$Name%in%team_chart$Name)
team_chart<-subset(team_chart,Overall>89)

team_chart<-team_chart %>% select(c(Name,Reactions,Composure,Short.passing,Vision,Ball.control,Long.passing,Shot.power,Curve,Long.shots,Dribbling))

x<-team_chart
df<-t(x[,2:ncol(x)])
colnames(df)<-x[,1]
df<-as.data.frame(df)

radarchart::chartJSRadar(df[1],labs=rownames(df))
radarchart::chartJSRadar(df[2],labs=rownames(df))
radarchart::chartJSRadar(df[3],labs=rownames(df))
radarchart::chartJSRadar(df[4],labs=rownames(df))
radarchart::chartJSRadar(df[5],labs=rownames(df))
radarchart::chartJSRadar(df[6],labs=rownames(df))
```


d. We are interested in determining how the player's abilities in different positions changes with age. 
Repeat the analysis of question 2.a., but this time show the *34* different skills  
Which skills peak at youngest/oldest ages?
```{r}
different_skills <- fifa_players[,c(3,12:45)] %>% filter(Age<=35)  
mean_different_skills <- aggregate(.~Age, data=different_skills, FUN=mean)
different_skills_Age <- melt(mean_different_skills, "Age")
ggplot(data=different_skills_Age, aes(x=Age, y=value, group=variable))+geom_line(aes(col=variable))+facet_wrap(~variable)+theme(legend.position = "none")+ggtitle("3.")
```
the skills that reaching the peak at the elder age are: Composure, Free kick accuracy, Reactions, Strength and GK skills,
the skills that reaching the peak at the younger age are: 
Balance, Acceleration, Agility and Sprint speed

e. Your boss suggests that some players may be currently under-payed compared to their performance,
and that we can acquire them by offering them a higher salary (`wage`).  <br>
Fit a multiple regression model predicting player's `overall` performance based on their `wage` and `age`. <br>
Find the $10$ players with the highest difference between their `wage` performance level and the regression model prediction, 
and list them in a table. 
```{r}
wages <- fifa_players %>% select(Wage)
ages <- fifa_players %>% select(Age)
Overall <- fifa_players %>% select(Overall)
wage_age_overall <-cbind(wages,ages,Overall)
new_predict_temp <- lm(Overall~. ,data = wage_age_overall)
New_Predict <- new_predict_temp$fitted.values
wage_age_overall_1<-cbind(wage_age_overall,New_Predict)
Name <- fifa_players %>% select(Name)
wage_age_overall_2 <- cbind(Name,wage_age_overall_1)
wage_age_overall_2$Diff <- wage_age_overall_2$Overall- wage_age_overall_2$New_Predict
top_n(wage_age_overall_2, 10, Diff) %>% arrange(desc(Diff))

```
these players are under-payed compared to their performance, so we may think they are not as good as they really are, 
and they would agree to move to other team if we will offer higher salary.

## Q4. Fix Problematic Plots (10 pt)

The previous data-analyst of the club was fired for producing poor plots. 
See below two bar plots that he made including their code. 

a. Describe in your own words what did your predecessor try to show in each of the two plots. 
b. Find *at least* three *different* problematic issues with his plots, and explain them. 
c. Fix the problematic issues above in the code below to generate new, improved plots. <br>
You will get an additional *bonus* point for finding any additional problem and fixing it.  
(identifying the *same* problem in the two plots counts as *one* problem).


```{r}
# A measure of category's diversity
DIV <- function(category_vec){
  t <- table(category_vec)
  p <- t/sum(t)
  return(sum(p^2))
}

cleaned_data <- fifa_players %>% select(Nationality,Club) %>% na.omit()

number_of_nationality_in_club <- cleaned_data %>% group_by(Club, Nationality) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% group_by(Club) %>% summarise(N_nation=n()) %>% arrange(desc(N_nation)) %>% mutate(Club = factor(Club, level=unique(Club)))

DIV_in_club <- cleaned_data %>% group_by(Club) %>% summarise(DIV = DIV(Nationality))%>% arrange(DIV)%>% mutate(Club = factor(Club,level=unique(Club)))  # arrange(desc(DIV)) %>% 

# Plot number of different nationalities in each club
g <- ggplot(data = number_of_nationality_in_club %>% head(8), aes(x = Club, y = N_nation,color = Club))
g + geom_bar(stat="identity")

# Plot DIV (diversity?) of different nationalities in each club
g <- ggplot(data = DIV_in_club %>% head(12),aes(x = Club,y = DIV, color = Club))
g <- g + geom_bar(stat="identity")
g
```
a. first graph: the predecessor tried to show in which club the players come from the widest variety of countries
second graph: the same, but in precentage.
b. all of the columns are in the same color which makes it hard to see the diffrences between then, The names of the clubs on the X-axis hide each other and it is difficult to understand which column refers to which club, y-axis is not well informative, and it makes it hard to understand what does it mean.
there are no headlines in both graphs.
